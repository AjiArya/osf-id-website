    <h4>WHY OPENSOURCE?</h4>
    <p>
    Because it works. OpenStack has proven the model, becoming one of the 3 most actively developed open source projects on the planet, with thousands of developers from over xx countries.
    And it powers everything from massively popular games like Overwatch to the largest power company in the world in China, to Workday, to ATT's 5G networks and beyond.</p>
    <p>
    Now we're ready to share this radically open method for developing open source software with the world beyond OpenStack, helping people build and operate open infrastructure.

    <h4>Built on the 4 Opens, Build by the Community</h4>
    <p>
    Modern apps rely on automated infrastructure, from massive datacenter clouds to the smallest edge nodes for IoT and 5g, and none of it is possible without open source software.</p>
    <p>That's Open Infrastructure, and the OSF exists to ensure each open source component is built and tested together, collaboratively, with a radical approach to openness we call
    the "Four Opens".</p>
    <p>From Community where anyone is welcome, to Design where diverse ideas are shared before the coding begins, to Development when every patch is visible and tested before it lands, to the Source code itself which is shared with the world, each is critical to how we deliver open source.</p>

      This is where we will talk about the changing environment and how one project can’t do all of the things. We’ll touch on how infrastructure has evolved and how these sfas will help drive infrastructure in the future.</p>

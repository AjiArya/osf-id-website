        <p class="fix-h5">We believe that communities thrive by focusing on relationships. OSF staff are active members of each community that we support with a hands-on approach. We not only devote resources, energy and attention to helping each project succeed, but also take the success and health of each community personally. . We value the importance of each community’s unique culture and celebrate it. We’re also experts and here to provide guidance in the important and necessary areas like open source governance. Whatever is needed, we’re here to help.

        <h3 class="fix-h3">Project Formation & Launch</h3>
        <p class="fix-h5">Starting from scratch is challenging, but we’re here to help! We believe that most successful projects start with code first. Code before hype. From there our team has expertise in organizing all of the details that go into establishing an open source project from the very beginning and, when the time is right, launching it more broadly with great awareness and maximum impact. From open source licensing to marketing and everything in between, we cover all the bases.

        <h3 class="fix-h3">Host at OSF</h3>
        <p class="fix-h5">The OSF approach to open source provides a home for Open Infrastructure communities that align with the “Four Opens” philosophy:</p>
        <ul class="fix-h5">
          <li>open source</li>
          <li>open design</li>
          <li>open development</li>
          <li>open community</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fix-h5">
          Communities want to work with us because we help projects thrive and truly believe that collaboration is the key to success. The OSF staff is a small team, but we make a big impact. Collectively we support the largest, most active, and engaged open source infrastructure communities globally.
        </p>
        <p class="fix-h5">
          OSF operates efficiently based on years of experience figuring out what works and what doesn’t,  with a focus on community development. We dedicate our resources towards advancing the project goals and growing adoption. Our strength lies in the communities we serve.

        <h3 class="fix-h3">A Customized Approach</h3>
        <p class="fix-h5">At OSF we value project individuality and collaboration. The quality of each project is our main focus, not the overall quantity of projects we host. There is no template or a one-size-fits-all model for the way we engage and support open source projects. Each project is unique and each community has specific needs. We welcome every project with personalized support and attention to detail. Our team is genuinely cheerful, helpful, knowledgeable and passionate about helping communities grow and thrive. We do not sit on the sidelines; we actively participate in each and every community that we serve</p>
        <p class="fix-h5">
          Our model provides the support system and collaborative environment so that communities are able to focus their attention on the important work of building software that works in real life and solves tough problems for end users around the globe.

**Bloomberg Joins as a Gold Member, Recognizing a Decade of Commitment to OpenStack**

Since 2013, Bloomberg—which uses the power of technology to connect the world’s decision makers with accurate information about the financial markets in order to help them make faster, smarter business and investment decisions—has run a number of production-quality OpenStack clusters. These clusters support various workloads, including web, machine learning, software development, databases and more. Its engineers have also been deeply involved with the OpenStack Operators group, including hosting some mid-cycle meetups.

“Thanks to OpenStack, our BCC platform alleviates many time-consuming tasks by providing Bloomberg’s engineers with tools to help them build, configure and maintain the computing and storage resources required by their applications,” explains Dmitry Margolin, manager of compute engineering.

“Open Development” refers to the adoption of transparent and inclusive development processes that enable everyone to participate as an equal on a level playing field. Publicly-accessible services means that everyone can see everything about development activities, without even needing to sign up to a service. Open development also means that all patches are welcome for consideration, whether that patch is from a project founder or a first-time contributor. A successful open source project will adopt a set of standards that clearly states the metrics and standards that a contribution will be evaluated against. By defining these standards we create an egalitarian process in which contributions are evaluated on a level playing field.

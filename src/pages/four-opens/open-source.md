Any software developed under the Four Opens must be released under an open source license. It means being able to study a program, modify it, and redistribute either the original or the modified version so that others may benefit from your work. That is a minimum standard for what we mean by “Open source” in the Four Opens. Beyond that, we want the software to be truly usable and scalable. This adds the additional condition that it should not be limited in features or crippled in performance to artificially enable any business model.

What that means more directly: We do not produce “open core” software. We are committed to creating truly open source software that is usable and scalable. Truly open source software is not feature or performance limited and is not crippled. There will be no “Enterprise Edition.”

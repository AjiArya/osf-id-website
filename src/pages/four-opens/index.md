The Four Opens are a set of principles guidelines that were created by the OpenStack community as a way to guarantee that the users get all the benefits associated with open source software, including the ability to engage with the community and influence future evolution of the software.

Under these guidelines, the OpenStack community grew from tens of contributors to thousands, creating one of the top three most active open source projects in the world behind the Linux Kernel and Chromium. The Four Opens were instrumental not only in this success but also in building a thriving, global community.

We at OSF consider The Four Opens our guiding principles in everything we do.

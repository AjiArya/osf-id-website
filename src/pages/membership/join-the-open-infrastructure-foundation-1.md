We believe digital infrastructure is core to human progress in every country, company and industry. We also believe that community driven open source is the best way to develop technology that is broadly available for use around the world.

We build open source communities that write software that runs in production

## COMMUNITIES WE SUPPORT

Staying true to our mission of helping people build and operate open infrastructure, OSF supports open source projects that contribute to the advancement of today’s infrastructure. From cloud hosting to the driving force behind 5G, these projects are code first and operate under the guiding principles we call the “Four Opens”.

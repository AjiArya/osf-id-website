The OpenStack Foundation promotes the global development, distribution and adoption of open infrastructure with more than 105,000 community members from 187 countries around the world. The OpenStack Foundation was founded in September 2012 to provide an independent home for the OpenStack cloud operating system, which has since become one of the largest and most diverse open source projects in history.

The goal of the OpenStack Foundation is to serve developers, users, and the entire open infrastructure ecosystem by providing a set of shared resources to build community, facilitate collaboration and support integration of open source technologies. Primary activities include organizing large-scale test infrastructure, community management, and bringing together more than 20,000 open infrastructure enthusiasts each year at global events including the Open Infrastructure Summit (formerly the OpenStack Summit).

In December 2017, the OpenStack Foundation began incubating new Strategic Focus Areas, starting with Container Infrastructure, CI/CD and Edge Computing. The Strategic Focus Areas include include new pilot projects and communities, the first of which are Kata Containers, Zuul and the Edge Computing Group. If you are interested in building an open infrastructure project at the OpenStack Foundation, contact <mailto:ecosystem@openstack.org>.

The Foundation wouldn't be possible without a strong [ecosystem of companies](https://osf.dev/companies/) that have contributed in many different ways. To learn more about our Platinum Members, Gold Members and Corporate Sponsors, check out the [supporter recognition page](https://osf.dev/companies/). If your company is interested in becoming a supporter, [read more about it here](https://www.openstack.org/join/#sponsor).

[Individual membership of the OpenStack Foundation](https://www.openstack.org/join/) is free for anyone with an interest in open infrastructure. Individual Members are expected to participate in the community through technical contributions or community building efforts, and vote in an annual election for the Board of Directors.

      <p class="is-6">I started my working career in technology close to twenty
      years ago. It has surely not  been an average career, but a career where
      I've continually learned and evolved to fulfill the need. In  a sense, it
      all started with Linux and answering some questions about installing
      Linux. This started a  journey into computer networking and eventually
      shifted to a systems engineering focus with a stop-over  in data center
      operations.</p> <p>The DevOps movement lead me more into software
      development and the operationalization of software due  to the need to
      automate large scale systems deployments. This required bringing an
      operational perspective  while bridging to the requirements, and often
      required digging deep into the underlying code to solve the  problem of
      the day.</p> <p>In a sense, I found a home in OpenStack in 2014 and the
      Ironic project in 2015 because of many years  spent working with physical
      hardware in data centers.</p> <p>I presently work for Red Hat as a
      Principal Software Engineer, where my upstream focus has been Ironic  for
      the past few years, and my downstream focus has been on helping lead
      adoption and use of Ironic. </p>
